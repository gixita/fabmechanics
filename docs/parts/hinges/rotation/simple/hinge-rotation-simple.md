# Draft : Simple Detachable 3D Printed Hinge
> ! This is generated by AI for the purpose of brainstorming. Will be written in the future by a human. Do not use this information for your design.

## Definition
A simple detachable hinge is a mechanical component consisting of two interlocking parts that can rotate relative to each other around a common axis. This type of hinge supports rotation in one direction but can easily detach when force is applied in other directions, making it suitable for applications requiring quick assembly/disassembly but with limited load capacity.

## Print Orientation Analysis
### Vertical Orientation (Z-axis hinge pin)
Advantages: Better layer adhesion around the critical rotation surfaces, higher strength against rotational forces.
Drawbacks: More support material required, longer print time, visible layer lines on the curved surfaces.
### Horizontal Orientation (X/Y-axis hinge pin)
Advantages: Faster printing, less support material, smoother rotation surfaces.
Drawbacks: Layer delamination risk under load, weaker overall structure due to layer orientation.
## Stress Resistance Evaluation
### Rotational Stress
The hinge performs well under normal rotational movement when printed vertically, as the layers align perpendicular to the rotation axis. Horizontal printing creates weakness as the rotation force acts between layers rather than across them.
### Tensile/Compressive Stress
Limited resistance to pulling forces in any orientation, as the design allows for easy separation. Under compression, the hinge performs adequately when the force aligns with the intended load direction.
### Shear Stress
Poor resistance to lateral (shear) forces in all print orientations, as the design prioritizes easy assembly/disassembly over lateral stability.
## Clearance Specifications
### Vertical Print Orientation
Recommended clearance of 0.2-0.3mm between mating surfaces to accommodate first layer compression and Z-axis artifacts.
### Horizontal Print Orientation
Recommended clearance of 0.3-0.4mm to account for potential stringing, elephant's foot, and X/Y dimensional inaccuracies.
## Material Considerations
PLA: Use tighter clearances (0.1-0.2mm)
ABS/PETG: Use wider clearances (0.3-0.4mm) to account for shrinkage
## Design Optimization Tips
### Pin Diameter
Increase pin diameter for greater strength, this type of hinge should be bulky to overcome the interlayer adhesion.
## Conclusion
The simple detachable hinge represents a fundamental mechanical design that balances ease of assembly with limited directional strength. Vertical printing orientation offers the best performance for rotational forces, while proper clearance specification is critical for functionality regardless of orientation. This design serves as an excellent introduction to the principles of FDM-optimized mechanical components, demonstrating the importance of print orientation, layer adhesion, and clearance specifications in functional parts.
